Perform a secondary tokenization of the data to obtain bigrams. Fit a logistic principal component regression model to the word-tokenized data, and then input the predicted log-odds-ratios together with some number of principal components of the bigram-tokenized data to a second logistic regression model. Based on the results, does it seem like the bigrams capture additional information about the claims status of a page?
