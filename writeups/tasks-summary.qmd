### HTML scraping

Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

In order to include the header as apart of the text we included 'h' along with 'p' in the html elements of the text parsing of the preprocessing code. Including the header improved our predictions by almost 2% accuracy. Before the header was included, our neural network model had a binary classification accuracy of 0.75, and after including the headers, the model's binary classification accuracy was 0.77. Our group came to the conclusion that th4e header of a webpage should be included in any further models we design in this project.

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

### Neural net

Summarize the neural network model you trained by describing:

-   architecture: For the architecture of the Neural Network model we trained, we applied the preprocessing layer, changed the layer_dropout to 0.75 instead of the original 0.25, we kept the first layer_dense to 25 units, and also kept the second layer_dense to 1 unit.

-   optimization and loss: We kept loss as binary cross entropy and the optimizer remained as 'adam'

-   training epochs: We kept loss as binary cross entropy and the optimizer remained as 'adam'

-   predictive accuracy: Each of these components resulted in a predictive accuracy of 0.81 on the test set.
